### Document Purpose

This file is the **master execution guide** for Industrial Brain AI. It converts the finalized Architecture Report into an executable engineering roadmap.

| This document IS | This document is NOT |
|---|---|
| Implementation planning | A second architecture document |
| Milestone & task tracking | A redesign of modules or tech |
| Progress & dependency management | A place to invent new features |
| Definition of Done + validation | A substitute for the Architecture Report |

**Rule:** If this plan and the Architecture Report ever appear to conflict, **the Architecture Report wins**. Update this plan to re-align; never silently drift.

# 1. Project Overview

## 1.1 Project Vision

Build an **AI-powered Industrial Knowledge Intelligence Platform** — an Industrial Digital Brain that transforms disconnected engineering documentation into continuously evolving, explainable operational intelligence.

Users explore **industrial assets**, receive **knowledge**, interact with **AI**, and make better **decisions**.

## 1.2 Project Goal

Deliver a production-bound modular monolith (hackathon = Version 1) that:

1. Discovers and catalogs a multi-domain industrial corpus (~27,300 documents) from Google Drive  
2. Continuously indexes knowledge with Adaptive Prioritization  
3. Centers UX on **Asset 360** (Motors as hackathon hero)  
4. Provides explainable health scores, AI summaries, recommendations, and an Industrial Copilot with citations  
5. Remains asset-agnostic so pumps, valves, compressors, boilers, turbines, pipelines, chemical plants, and oil refineries work without redesign  

## 1.3 Target Problem Statement

Industrial engineers manage tens of thousands of engineering documents across drawings, datasheets, test reports, manuals, safety procedures, regulations, certifications, sensors, and SOPs. Finding the right evidence for one asset takes hours. Knowledge is fragmented across folders, formats, and systems.

**Industrial Brain AI** collapses that fragmentation into an asset-first intelligence experience.

## 1.4 Hackathon Goal (Version 1 — Jul 16–19, 2026)

| Objective | Success Criteria |
|---|---|
| Scale narrative | Catalog ≈27,300 docs; show live Continuous Intelligent Indexing |
| Hero demo | One fully indexed **Motor Asset 360** end-to-end |
| Intelligence | AI Summary + Explainable Health Score + Recommendations + Copilot with citations |
| Differentiator | Drawing-number cross-reference graph spine |
| Enterprise feel | Asset-first UX — never “chat with PDF” |

**Compressed calendar (Architecture §24 overlay):**

| Day | Phases | Critical Path |
|---|---|---|
| Day 1 | Phase 1 + start Phase 2 | Discovery, asset registry, fleet dashboard |
| Day 2 | Finish Phase 2 + Phase 3 | Hero Motor Asset 360 complete |
| Day 3 | Phase 4 core + Phase 5 minimum + Phase 6 | Copilot, compliance, RBAC lite, demo polish |

## 1.5 Production Goal

Evolve the same modular monolith into an on-prem / hybrid enterprise platform:

- Customer blob / SharePoint / NAS connectors (replacing Google Drive as primary source)  
- Docling + PaddleOCR primary parsing; bge-m3 embeddings; vLLM + Llama on-prem  
- OIDC/SAML IdP, full RBAC, immutable audit, observability  
- Multi-site, multi-asset-type Asset 360 depth  

## 1.6 North Star

> **Assets are the application. Documents are evidence. Knowledge is the product. AI is the interface.**

**Primary workflow:** Asset → Knowledge → AI → Decision

## 1.7 Expected Final Product

| Layer | Deliverable |
|---|---|
| Backend | FastAPI modular monolith + Celery/Redis workers |
| Frontend | Next.js App Router enterprise web app |
| Data | PostgreSQL (SoR) + Neo4j (derived graph) + Qdrant (semantic index) + object storage |
| Intelligence | Agentic Hybrid Graph RAG via LangGraph |
| Flagship UX | Asset 360 (Motor specialization for demo) |
| Ops | Docker Compose local; hybrid cloud demo path |

## 1.8 One-Page Executive Summary

Industrial Brain AI is an asset-agnostic Industrial Knowledge Intelligence Platform. Over a real multi-domain corpus (~27,300 engineering documents on Google Drive; Motors 20,134 as the richest hero domain), the system discovers documents, continuously indexes them with Adaptive Prioritization, builds a motor-centric knowledge graph (drawing-number spine), and surfaces explainable operational intelligence through Asset Explorer, Asset 360, Timeline, AI Summary, Health Score, Recommendations, Knowledge Graph, Compliance, Maintenance Intelligence, and Industrial Copilot.

Technically it is a **Modular Monolith**: FastAPI + Next.js + PostgreSQL + Neo4j + Qdrant + Redis/Celery + LangGraph + Azure Document Intelligence (hackathon) with a credible on-prem path. Business rules (health, compliance, scoring) live in Python services — never in LLM prompts. Hackathon Version 1 proves one complete Motor Asset 360 digital twin journey; architecture already supports every other industrial asset type without redesign.

---

# 2. Development Principles

These rules are **binding** for every implementation prompt. They align with Architecture §23 Engineering Governance.

## 2.1 Phase Discipline

1. **Never skip phases.** Foundation → Document Intelligence → Asset Intelligence → Industrial AI → Enterprise → Polish.  
2. **Never jump milestones** inside a phase unless the active milestone is Complete.  
3. **Never implement future milestones** “while we’re here.”  
4. **Never build UI before backend foundations** for that capability.  
5. **Never build AI before data exists** for that capability.  
6. **Never build dashboards before intelligence exists** for that capability.  

## 2.2 Architecture Fidelity

7. **Do not redesign the architecture.**  
8. **Do not change technologies** listed in Architecture §21.  
9. **Do not invent new modules** outside Architecture’s recommended module set.  
10. **Do not contradict** persistence hierarchy: PostgreSQL = SoR; Neo4j/Qdrant = derived.  
11. Prefer **extension over duplication**; reuse services, repositories, schemas.  

## 2.3 Codebase Hygiene

12. **Never create unnecessary files or folders.**  
13. **Never duplicate** business logic, models, schemas, repositories, services, APIs, or utilities.  
14. Prefer **fewer high-quality files** (300–500 lines acceptable) over many tiny files.  
15. No `helpers.py` / `utils.py` / `misc.py` / `common.py` / `shared.py` dumping grounds without architectural justification.  
16. No placeholder / stub implementations unless explicitly marked `PLACEHOLDER:` with owner + follow-up milestone.  
17. No God classes, God services, or God files.  

## 2.4 Quality Bars

18. Follow **modular monolith** boundaries (Architecture §9, §23).  
19. Every feature must have **validation**.  
20. Every API must have **typed schemas** (Pydantic / Zod as applicable).  
21. Every module must remain **independently understandable**.  
22. All code must be **production quality** — hackathon is V1 of production, not a throwaway demo.  
23. Every commit must leave the project **runnable**.  
24. **Document every assumption** in this plan’s Assumptions Log when discovered.  
25. **Never hardcode** secrets, URLs, model names as magic strings in business logic — use configuration / environment variables.  
26. **Never use `print()`** — structured logging only.  
27. Routes only: Validate → Call Services → Return Response.  
28. LLMs own reasoning/narration; **Python services own deterministic scores and compliance logic**.  

## 2.5 Product Language Rules (UI)

| Use on screen | Never use on screen |
|---|---|
| Industrial Digital Brain | RAG |
| Knowledge Intelligence | Vector database / embeddings |
| Continuous Intelligent Indexing | Wave 1 / Wave 2 |
| Adaptive Prioritization | “Only N reports parsed” |
| Asset 360 / Motor 360 | Document upload demo framing |
| Explainable Health Score | ML prediction |

# 3. Development Workflow

```
Architecture Report (immutable authority)
        ↓
Phase (sequential — never skip)
        ↓
Milestone (one active at a time)
        ↓
Task (one primary in-progress task)
        ↓
Subtask
        ↓
Implementation (scoped only to active task)
        ↓
Validation Checklist (manual + automated)
        ↓
Testing (unit / API / integration as required by milestone DoD)
        ↓
Update Progress Tracker in this document
        ↓
Mark Task → Milestone Complete
        ↓
STOP — suggest next milestone; do not auto-continue
```

## 3.1 Cursor Execution Loop (Mandatory)

On every user implementation request:

1. **Read** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (this file) and confirm Architecture alignment  
2. **Identify** Current Phase / Milestone / Task  
3. **Check** Depends On / Blocked By  
4. **Mark** task In Progress in Progress Tracker  
5. **Implement** only that scope  
6. **Validate** against Definition of Done + Validation Checklist  
7. **List** files created/modified and why each exists  
8. **Update** tracker (status, notes, completion date)  
9. **Suggest** next task/milestone  
10. **Stop** — do not auto-advance into the next milestone  

## 3.2 Hard Prohibitions

- Cursor must **NEVER** jump between phases  
- Cursor must **NEVER** implement Milestone N+1 while Milestone N is incomplete  
- Cursor must **NEVER** “also quickly add” Enterprise/AI features during Foundation  
- Cursor must **NEVER** modify the Architecture Report unless the user explicitly requests it

# 7. Subtask Breakdown

Subtasks define the micro-execution steps and Definition of Done for each task family. When implementing a task, complete its subtasks in order.

---

## 7.1 Pattern Applied to Every Task

Every task must be executed as:

1. Confirm dependencies satisfied  
2. Implement minimum necessary files only  
3. Wire configuration via env  
4. Add/adjust typed schemas  
5. Add structured logs  
6. Add or update tests required by milestone DoD  
7. Run validation steps  
8. Update Progress Tracker  

---

## 7.2 Milestone 1.1 Subtasks (Example Fully Expanded)

### Task 1.1.1 — Create monorepo / workspace layout

| Subtask | DoD |

|---|---|
| Create pyproject/requirements | Installable |
| Pin core deps: fastapi, uvicorn, sqlalchemy, alembic, pydantic-settings, httpx, celery/redis clients | Documented in `.env.example` counterparts |
| Local `uvicorn` boot smoke | Health route later; import works |

### Task 1.1.3 — Initialize frontend Next.js TypeScript app

## 7.6 Phase 2–6 Subtask Standard (Apply Per Task)

For each remaining task, Cursor must expand subtasks at implementation time using this template and record completion in the tracker notes:

```
Task: <ID> <Name>
Subtasks:
  1. Design fit check vs Architecture (where it belongs)
  2. Implement service + repository + schema (only needed layers)
  3. Wire API route (if any) with validation
  4. Add logs + config
  5. Tests required by milestone
  6. Manual validation steps
  7. Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md tracker
Definition of Done:
  - Feature works for hero-motor path (or foundation path)
  - No architecture drift
  - No unnecessary files
  - Project still runnable
```

**Phase 2 critical expanded DoDs:**

| Milestone | Must Prove |
|---|---|
| 2.1 | Tier router selects correct parser; Azure DI extracts a test-report table |
| 2.2 | Drawing numbers extracted; test measurements stored |
| 2.3 | Chunks carry required metadata payload |
| 2.4 | Embeddings versioned |
| 2.5 | Filtered vector search returns hero-motor chunks |
| 2.6 | Cypher from MotorModel center returns linked docs |
| 2.7 | Hybrid retrieval returns reranked top results |
| 2.8 | Citations resolve to real chunks |
| 2.9 | Priority queue processes test reports before drawings; status API live |

**Phase 3 critical expanded DoDs:**

| Milestone | Must Prove |
|---|---|
| 3.1 | Hero motor selected; hierarchy queryable |
| 3.2 | Explorer filters work at catalog scale |
| 3.3 | Bundle API returns all Asset 360 zones |
| 3.4 | Timeline chronological with honest estimated badges |
| 3.5 | Summary fields cited or “Not available…” |
| 3.6 | Score deterministic; bullets evidence-backed; LLM does not own score |
| 3.7 | 3–5 recommendation cards with citations |
| 3.8 | Drawing cross-ref shows multi-folder docs |
| 3.9 | Graph UI motor-centered |
| 3.10 | Unified search returns motors + docs |
| 3.11 | Dashboard shows discovered/indexed/processing counts |
| 3.12 | Flagship page demo-ready for hero motor |

**Phase 4–6:** Apply same template; Copilot must stream citations; compliance/health remain Python-owned; golden eval runs before demo.

# 13. Future Prompt Rules (For Cursor)

These rules are **self-instructions**. Follow automatically without user reminder.

1. **Always read this file first** before coding.  
2. **Never work outside the active milestone** unless the user explicitly names a different milestone **and** its dependencies are Complete.  
3. **Never implement future milestones** opportunistically.  
4. **Always finish** the current task/milestone DoD before suggesting the next.  
5. **Always update** Active Execution Cursor + Progress Tracker.  
6. **Always validate** before marking Complete.  
7. **Always mention** files modified and files created.  
8. **Always explain why each new file exists** (single responsibility).  
9. **Never create unnecessary folders.**  
10. **Never duplicate** services, utilities, models, repositories, or APIs.  
11. **Never modify the Architecture Report** unless explicitly requested.  
12. **Never change technologies** or invent modules.  
13. **Never hardcode secrets.**  
14. **Never put business rules in LLM prompts** when Architecture assigns them to Python services.  
15. **Never expose RAG/embedding jargon** in UI copy.  
16. If a request would cause architecture drift: **pause, explain, propose Architecture-aligned alternative, then implement that.**  
17. After completing a milestone: **stop** and wait for the next user instruction (or explicit “continue to next milestone”).  
18. Prefer extending an existing module over creating a new one.  
19. Keep commits runnable (when user asks to commit).  
20. Keep this document synchronized with reality after every implementation session.  

---

# 14. Engineering Standards

## 14.1 Folder Organization

- Feature modules under `backend/app/<module>/`  
- Typical contents: `api` (or router), `service`, `repository`, `schema`, `model` — **only as needed**  
- Frontend routes under `frontend/app/` matching Architecture navigation  
- Tests mirror modules under `backend/tests/`  

## 14.2 Naming Conventions

| Kind | Convention |
|---|---|
| Python modules | `snake_case` |
| Classes | `PascalCase` |
| Functions / vars | `snake_case` |
| React components | `PascalCase.tsx` |
| API paths | `/api/v1/resource` plural nouns |
| DB tables | `snake_case` plural |
| Env vars | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` |
| Error codes | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` |

## 14.3 Dependency Injection

- FastAPI `Depends` for request-scoped resources  
- Services receive repositories via constructors/factories  
- No hidden global mutable state  

## 14.4 Configuration

- `pydantic-settings` (or equivalent) single Settings object  
- `.env` local; `.env.example` committed  
- Feature flags only if Architecture-needed  

## 14.5 Logging

- Structured JSON  
- Include `request_id`, module, job_id where relevant  
- Log pipeline stage transitions  

## 14.6 Error Handling

- Central handlers  
- Envelope `{ data, meta, errors }`  
- Stable `error_code` values (`ASSET_NOT_FOUND`, `INGESTION_FAILED`, `PERMISSION_DENIED`, …)  

## 14.7 Database Design

- PostgreSQL is system of record  
- Alembic migrations required for schema changes  
- Asset-agnostic `asset_type` discriminator; motor tables specialize hero domain  
- No Neo4j/Qdrant as SoR  

## 14.8 Repository Pattern

- Repositories own SQL  
- No business rules inside repositories  

## 14.9 Service Pattern

- Services own domain logic  
- Orchestrate repositories + external adapters  
- Keep routes thin  

## 14.10 DTOs / Schemas / Validation

- Pydantic request/response models for all public APIs  
- Zod (or equivalent) on frontend forms when needed  
- Never trust raw request bodies  

## 14.11 Type Safety

- Python type hints on public functions  
- TypeScript `strict` preferred  
- Avoid `Any` unless boundary-justified  

## 14.12 Testing

- pytest unit/API/integration  
- AI eval harness for retrieval/citations  
- Playwright for critical UX path  
- Testing begins in Phase 1 — not deferred entirely to Phase 6  

## 14.13 API Versioning

- All public HTTP APIs under `/api/v1/`  
- Breaking changes require new version — do not silently break clients  

## 14.14 Git Conventions

- Never develop directly on `main`  
- Feature branches  
- Meaningful commits focused on why  
- Commit only when user requests  

## 14.15 Documentation

- Prefer self-explanatory code  
- Update this Implementation Plan on progress  
- Avoid proliferating extra markdown files  

---

# 15. File Creation Policy

## 15.1 Mandatory Pre-Creation Checklist

Before creating **any** new file, answer:

1. Can existing code be reused or extended?  
2. Can this functionality live in an existing module?  
3. Is this file actually necessary for the active milestone?  
4. Does it increase maintainability (not just file count)?  
5. Does it have a **single clear responsibility**?  
6. Would Architecture §9/§23 endorse this file’s location?  

If any answer fails → **do not create the file**.

## 15.2 Prohibitions

- No duplicate helper utilities  
- No duplicate services / models / repositories / APIs  
- No speculative folders for future phases  
- No empty `__init__` sprawl beyond package needs  
- No “temporary” files without deletion plan  
- No parallel architecture experiments in-tree  

## 15.3 Preference Order

1. Extend existing service  
2. Add method to existing repository  
3. Add schema fields to existing DTO  
4. Create new file in existing module  
5. Create new module **only** if Architecture already defined it and milestone requires it  

## 15.4 When a New File Is Created

Document in the implementation response:

- Path  
- Responsibility  
- Why existing files were insufficient  
- Milestone/task ID it serves  

---

# 16. Implementation Tracking Rules

Whenever the user asks to implement anything, Cursor must automatically:

1. Identify **Current Phase**  
2. Identify **Current Milestone**  
3. Identify **Current Task** (or first Not Started task in milestone)  
4. Mark task **In Progress** in this document  
5. Implement **only that scope**  
6. Run **Validation Checklist** items that apply  
7. Update Progress Tracker percentages/notes  
8. Mark task **Complete** only if DoD met  
9. If milestone DoD met → mark milestone Complete; update Active Execution Cursor to next milestone  
10. Suggest the next task/milestone  
11. **Stop**  

### Progress Percentage Guidance

| Level | Formula |
|---|---|
| Milestone progress | Complete tasks / total tasks in milestone |
| Phase progress | Complete milestones / total milestones in phase |
| Overall progress | Weighted by phase gates (Phase 1–6); do not claim Phase 3 progress during Phase 1 |

---

# 17. Prompt Protocol

## 17.1 Standard User Prompts

### A) Build a milestone

**User:** `Build Milestone 1.2`

**Cursor must:**

1. Read `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`  
2. Locate Milestone 1.2  
3. Verify dependencies (1.1 Complete)  
4. Implement only Milestone 1.2 tasks/subtasks  
5. Run Milestone 1.2 validations + DoD  
6. Update tracker (1.2 → Complete; set Active Cursor → 1.3)  
7. Summarize files created/modified + why  
8. **Stop — do not start Milestone 1.3**  

### B) Build a task

**User:** `Implement Task 1.6.2 Discovery Pass`

**Cursor must:** stay within Task 1.6.2; update only that task; stop.

### C) Continue

**User:** `Continue` / `Next milestone`

**Cursor must:** advance exactly one milestone (the next Not Started with deps satisfied), then stop.

### D) Status

**User:** `Where are we?`

**Cursor must:** answer from Active Execution Cursor + Phase/Milestone trackers only.

### E) Out-of-order request

If user asks for Phase 4 while Phase 1 incomplete:

1. Refuse to implement out of order  
2. Explain dependency  
3. Offer to continue the active milestone  

### F) Architecture conflict

If user asks for something that contradicts Architecture:

1. Pause  
2. Explain conflict with Architecture citation  
3. Propose aligned alternative  
4. Implement alternative only after alignment (or explicit user override documented in Assumptions Log)  

## 17.2 Required Response Footer (After Every Implementation)

```
Phase: <n>
Milestone: <id> <name> — <status>
Task: <id> <name> — <status>
Files created: ...
Files modified: ...
Validation: <pass/fail summary>
Tracker updated: yes
Next suggested: <milestone/task id>
```

## 17.3 Assumptions Log

| Date | Assumption | Impact | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-16 | Architecture Report path may live outside `docs/` (Cursor plan file); this Implementation Plan is the execution SoT | Dev must not edit Architecture | Keep sync manually when Architecture explicitly updated |
| 2026-07-16 | Hackathon auth may be JWT seed users for speed | Faster Phase 1.4 | Swap to Clerk/Auth0 if required without redesign |
| 2026-07-16 | Google Drive API access available before deep indexing | Blocks 1.6 | rclone fallback per Architecture |
| 2026-07-16 | Non-motor domains catalog-first for hackathon | Phase 3 depth focuses on Motors | Asset-agnostic schema still required |
| 2026-07-16 | Golden eval target 100+; hackathon minimum ≥30 ABB-grounded pairs acceptable to unlock demo | Phase 6.2 | Expand post-hackathon |

Add rows whenever a new assumption is made during implementation.

## 17.4 Synchronization Rules

| Event | Action |
|---|---|
| Milestone completed | Update §§ Active Cursor, 5, 6, 12 |
| New blocker found | Set status Blocked + note |
| User explicitly changes Architecture | Update this plan to match; still do not edit Architecture unless asked |
| Scope cut for hackathon MVP | Document in Assumptions Log + adjust Phase 5/6 notes — do not silently delete Architecture requirements |

## 17.5 Demo-Critical Path (Do Not Lose)

Regardless of parallel interest items, the **must-not-fail** chain is:

```
1.6 Drive Discovery → 1.7 Catalog → 2.9 Priority Index (hero docs)
  → 2.6/2.7 Graph + Retrieval → 3.1 Hero Motor → 3.12 Asset 360
  → 4.2 Copilot with citations → 6.3/6.6 Demo reliability
```

All other work supports this chain; never jeopardize it for non-critical polish.

# Appendix C — How to Resume After a Long Pause

1. Open `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`  
2. Read **Active Execution Cursor**  
3. Read Phase/Milestone trackers for Blocked/In Progress items
